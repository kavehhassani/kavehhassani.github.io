<h1>About Me</h1>
I am currently an AI Research Scientist at <a href="https://ai.meta.com/">Meta GenAI</a>, where I focus on LLMs and Agents. I am also a Machine Learning Lecturer at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>. Before joining Meta GenAI, I was an AI Research Scientist at Ranking AI Research at Meta working on large-scale graph and sequence learning for monetization. Prioir to that, I held the position of Principal AI Research Scientist and Research Manager at the <a href="https://www.research.autodesk.com/research-areas/science/ai-lab/">Autodesk AI Lab</a>. I earned my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the <a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/">University of Ottawa</a>, with a focus on deep learning for common-sense reasoning in 3D environments. My research encompasses a broad range of deep learning, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and Geometric Deep Learning (GDL), with applications spanning from healthcare to large-scale recommender systems. Currently, my research is focused on Large-Language Models (LLMs) and Agents. My reseach has been published in top-tier AI venues including NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, ICCV, and AAAI. Throughout my career, I have had the pleasure of collaborating with several institutions, including NASA, Stanford University, Vector Institute, and the University of British Columbia.
